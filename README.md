This repository is intended to serve as a storage place for documentation of Simone Roberts' diffusion-weighted imaging methodology, for the purpose of providing access to members of the Crosson Lab at Emory/Georgia State University/VA and our collaborators.  These manuals were also created for training purposes.
If you are a lab member or colleague and would like to be added for collaborative purposes or the ability to generate "issues", please email me and I will add you.
# In-house software that is not currently publicly available is required to follow these pipelines.

Future additions will include:
  1. T1 preparation procedures
  2. Post-processing to generate quantitative metrics
  3. Multi-shell processing pipeline
  4. Manuals for multi-use PanTrack scripts included in package

This repository is intended to serve as a storage place for documentation of Simone Roberts' diffusion-weighted imaging methodology, for the purpose of providing access to members of the Crosson Lab at Emory/Georgia State University/VA and our collaborators.  These manuals were also created for training purposes.
# In-house software that is not currently publicly available is required to follow these pipelines.

This repository is intended to serve as a storage place for documentation of Simone Roberts' diffusion-weighted imaging methodology, for the purpose of providing access to members of the Crosson Lab at Emory/Georgia State University/VA and our collaborators.  These manuals were also created for training purposes.

# In-house software that is not currently publicly available is required to follow some steps of these pipelines.

Future additions may include:
  1. T1 preparation procedures
  2. Automated T1-to-DWI Registration Pipeline
  3. Post-processing to generate quantitative metrics
  4. Multi-shell processing pipeline
  5. Manuals for multi-use PanTrack scripts included in package
